            <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed
                language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables
                you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
                CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the
                presentation of an HTML document.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:</li>


                    <li>Block, for sections in a webpage</li>
<li>Inline, for text</li>
<li>Table, for two-dimensional table data</li>
<li>Positioned, for explicit position of an element</li>
                </ul>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="what_you_should_already_know">
            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>

                1.Absolute positioning
                If you want control over where an element lives on our website at all times, absolute
                positioning is the key to making this happen. If you think of your browser as one big
                bounding box, absolute positioning allows you to control exactly where in that box an element
                will stay. Use top, right, bottom and left, accompanied by a pixel value to control where an element
                stays.

                <code>position:absolute;
                top:20px;
                right:20px</code>

                The CSS above sets the position of an element to stay 20px from the top and right edges of your browser.
                You can
                also use absolute positioning inside of a div.
            </p>

            <p> 2.Overriding all styles
                This should be used sparingly, because if you do this for everything, you’re going to find yourself in
                trouble
                in the long run. However, if you want to override another CSS style for a specific element, use
                !important after the
                style in your css. For example, if I wanted the H2 headers in a specific section of my site to be red
                instead of blue,
                I would use the following CSS:

                <code>.section h2 { color:red !important; }</code>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="css_grid">
            <header>Css Grid</header>

            <p>To define a Grid use display:grid or display:inline-grid on the parent element. You can then create
                a grid using the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties.

                I am using the grid-gap property to create a gap between my columns and rows of 10px. This property is
                a shorthand for grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap so you can set these values individually.

                All direct children of the parent now become grid items and the auto-placement algorithm lays them out,
                one in each grid cell. Creating extra rows as needed.</p>
            <p>
                CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of
                size,
                position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables, grid layout
                enables an
                author to align elements into columns and rows</p>


        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="css_styling">
            <header>Css Styling</header>

            <p>1. Vertical alignment (for one line of text)
                You will use this in a CSS navigation menu, I can almost guarantee that. The key is to make the height
                of the menu and the line-height of the text the same. I see this technique a lot when I go back and edit
                existing websites for clients. Here’s an example:

                <code>.nav li{
                    line-height:50px;
                    height:50px;
                }</code>
            </p>

            <p>2. Hover effects
                This is used for buttons, text links, bock sections of your site, icons, and more. If you want something
                to
                change colors when someone hovers their mouse over it, use the same CSS, but add :hover to it and change
                the
                styling. Here’s an example:

                <code>.entry h2{
                        font-size:36px;
                        color:#000;
                        font-weight:800;
                    }</code>
                    <main id="main-doc">
                        <nav id="navbar">

                                top:20px;
                                right:20px</code>
                
                                The CSS above sets the position of an element to stay 20px from the top and right edges of your browser.

                            </p>
                        </section>
                
                        <section class="main-section" id="css_grid">

                                styling. Here’s an example:
                
                                <code>.entry h2{
                                        font-size:36px;
                                        color:#000;
                                        font-weight:800;
                                    }</code>
                                    
                                    <code>.entry h2:hover{
                                        color:#f00;
                                    }</code>
                                What this does is it changes the color of your h2 tag from black to red when someone hovers over it. The
                                great thing about using :hover is that you don’t have to declare the font-size or weight again, if it
                                isn’t changing. It only changes what you specify.
                            </p>
                        </section>
                        <section class="main-section" id="css_flexbox">
                
                            <header>Css FlexBox</header>
                            <p>The flex-basis is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space
                                it leaves as available space. The initial value of this property is auto — in
                                this case the browser looks to see if the items have a size. In the example above,
                                all of the items have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the flex-basis.
                
                                If the items don't have a size then the content's size is used as the flex-basis. This is
                                why when we just declare display: flex on the parent to create flex items, the items all move
                                into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.</p>
                
                            <p>With the flex-grow property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the
                                main axis from their flex-basis. This will cause the item to stretch and take up any
                                available space on that axis, or a proportion of the available space if other items are
                                allowed to grow too. If we gave all of our items in the example above a flex-grow value of 1
                                then the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they
                                would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.
                
                                The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first item a

                                the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px
                                each out of
                                the 200px total).</p>
                
                            <p>Where the flex-grow property deals with adding space in the main axis, the flex-shrink property controls
                                how it is taken
                                away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items, and flex-shrink is set to a
                                positive integer,
                                then the item can become smaller than the flex-basis. As with flex-grow, different values can be
                                assigned in order to cause
                                one item to shrink faster than others — an item with a higher value set for flex-shrink will shrink
                                faster than its siblings
                                that have lower values.
                
                                The minimum size of the item will be taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage
                                that will happen, which means
                                that flex-shrink has the potential to appear less consistent than flex-grow in behavior. We'll therefore
                                take a more detailed look at how
                                this algorithm works in the article Controlling Ratios of items along the main axis.
                
                                Note: These values for flex-grow and flex-shrink are proportions. Typically if we had all of our items
                                set to flex: 1 1 200px and then wanted
                                one item to grow at twice the rate, we would set that item to flex: 2 1 200px. However you could also
                                use flex: 10 1 200px and flex: 20 1 200px if you wanted.</p>

                    }</code>
                What this does is it changes the color of your h2 tag from black to red when someone hovers over it. The
                great thing about using :hover is that you don’t have to declare the font-size or weight again, if it
                isn’t changing. It only changes what you specify.

            <p>The flex-basis is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space
                it leaves as available space. The initial value of this property is auto — in
                this case the browser looks to see if the items have a size. In the example above,
                all of the items have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the flex-basis.

                If the items don't have a size then the content's size is used as the flex-basis. This is
                why when we just declare display: flex on the parent to create flex items, the items all move
                into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.</p>

            <p>With the flex-grow property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the
                main axis from their flex-basis. This will cause the item to stretch and take up any
                available space on that axis, or a proportion of the available space if other items are
                allowed to grow too. If we gave all of our items in the example above a flex-grow value of 1
                then the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they
                would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.

                The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first item a
                flex-grow value of 2, and the other items a value of 1 each, 2 parts of the available space will be
                given to
                the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px
                each out of
                the 200px total).</p>

            <p>Where the flex-grow property deals with adding space in the main axis, the flex-shrink property controls
                how it is taken
                away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items, and flex-shrink is set to a
                positive integer,
                then the item can become smaller than the flex-basis. As with flex-grow, different values can be
                assigned in order to cause
                one item to shrink faster than others — an item with a higher value set for flex-shrink will shrink
                faster than its siblings
                that have lower values.
